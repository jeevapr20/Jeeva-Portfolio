      <h2>About</h2>
      <p style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;">Hi there! I'm an aspiring Full Stack Developer with a passion for creating seamless web applications. With 6 months of hands-on experience as an intern at Inmakes Infotech Pvt Ltd, I’ve had the chance to dive deep into both front-end and back-end development. From building dynamic user interfaces with React.js and Vite, to crafting robust APIs with Python, Django, and Django REST Framework, I’ve gained a solid foundation in full-stack development.

        <br><br>But that’s not all! I’ve also explored the world of the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), where I developed end-to-end solutions that are both scalable and efficient. My journey in tech has been fueled by a curiosity for problem-solving and a desire to build impactful digital solutions.
        
        <br><br>On top of my internship experience, I’ve earned certifications in Python from Coursera and Udemy, sharpening both my core programming skills and advanced techniques. With a background in Commerce, specializing in Finance and Taxation, I bring a unique business perspective to tech, enabling me to think both creatively and strategically.
        
        <br><br>I'm always eager to learn, grow, and take on new challenges. So, if you're looking for a passionate, adaptable developer ready to bring fresh ideas to life, let’s connect and build something amazing together!</p>
